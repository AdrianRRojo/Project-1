# About the Game
---
Card game similar to that of heartstone. Every card has a value, i.e 1-7. The player will play against the computer (Randomly generated card values).
Both the Player and the computer will have 5 turns, the winner is decided on who won more of those battles. If both the player and computer use a card of the same value the result is a tie and are allowed an extra turn. I will be using a constructor to create the cards and "powers" if i get to that stretch goal.

## MVP List
---
1. Swithces turn between player and AI
2. Winner and Loser
3. Will use CSS JS & HTML
4. Instructions will be listed on the side of the screen
5. PvE - The player will be playing against the computer.



# Stretch Goals

1. The cards could send visual attacks(Like a fireball) to the enemy card
2. Each card have its own character that has a visual made for it
3. Each battle will have its own background
